# Touch Swap

**Touch Swap** began as a clone of Tapwap but quickly evolved into something more. After launching the project, we decided to make the entire codebase open-source, providing a robust template for developers to use as a foundation for their own projects.

## Open Source Projects

- **Telegram App**: The Touch Swap Telegram app is fully open-source, allowing developers to explore, modify, and integrate it into their own applications.
- **Website**: The Touch Swap website is also open-source, offering a solid starting point for building web apps with modern technologies.

## Key Features

- **Firebase Integration**: Seamless backend operations with Firebase for authentication, real-time data, and cloud functions.
- **Next.js**: Fast and efficient server-side rendering, optimizing the user experience.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly-typed language support for enhanced code quality and developer productivity.
- **TypeORM**: Elegant data modeling with TypeORM, providing an abstraction layer over various database systems.
